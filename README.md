# Text-Mining-And-NLP
Throughtout this repsitory you will find various projects where I apply Text Mining and NLP to large amount of unstructer data and extract useful insights as well as to combine it with other analytical tools to confirm insights using R programming Language. This is the result of the MSBA at Hult International School.
